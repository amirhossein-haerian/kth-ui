# UI to demonstrate API main features

to run the project you need to first install the required packages using `npm install` and then run the project using `npm run dev`.

there is a `.env` file; inside the file I have put api_key and api url if you have run the API in a different address please change the address accordingly. 

This project shows a list of rooms and you can click on them to see each room detail inside a separate page.
